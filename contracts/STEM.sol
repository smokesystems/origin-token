 *  - The abiity for token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens
 *  - A minter role that allows for restricted, programmatic token minting (creation). See below.
 *  - A pauser role that allows all token transfers to be paused based on specific events
 *
 * This contract uses {AccessControl} to lock permissioned functions using the

 *
 * The account that deploys the contract will be granted the pauser
 * roles, as well as the default admin role, which will let it grant both minter
